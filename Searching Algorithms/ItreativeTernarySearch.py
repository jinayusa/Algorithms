# Ternary Search Implementation (Iterative)

# Ternary Search works by dividing the search space into three parts.
# Time Complexity: O(logâ‚ƒ n) (reduces search space by 1/3 each iteration)
# Space Complexity: O(1) (does not use extra memory)

# Example Usage:
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]  # Sorted array
target = 9
result = ternary_search(arr, target)
print(f"Element {target} found at index:", result)

# Edge Cases Considered:
# 1. Empty array: [] -> Should return -1
# 2. Single-element array (target present): [5], target = 5 -> Should return 0
# 3. Single-element array (target absent): [5], target = 2 -> Should return -1
# 4. Target at start: [1, 2, 3, 4], target = 1 -> Should return 0
# 5. Target at end: [1, 2, 3, 4], target = 4 -> Should return 3
# 6. Target not present: [1, 3, 5, 7], target = 6 -> Should return -1
